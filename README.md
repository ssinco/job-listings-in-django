# job-listings-in-django
### About Project
This project was created to demonstrate my learnings in using Django, a powerful web framework for Python. Throughout this project, I aimed to build a robust web application that showcases my understanding of Django's core concepts, including CRUD in django, models, views, templates, and forms. The project serves as a testament to my ability to integrate various components of the framework to create a functional, user-friendly application.
